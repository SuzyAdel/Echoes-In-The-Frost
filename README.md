8. # Animation
- set loop, and no looping
  
| Animation Clip | Loop Time? | Notes                     |
| -------------- | ---------- | ------------------------- |
| Sitting        | ‚úÖ Yes      | Idle, default             |
| Waving         | ‚úÖ Yes      | Can be triggered often    |
| TurnRight      | ‚ùå No       | One-time direction change |
| Walk           | ‚úÖ Yes      | Movement animation        |
| Pickup         | ‚ùå No       | Final one-time action     |

- Logic covers both Drone Wave and Kit Pickup flows with fallback to Sitting

| **Parameter** | **Purpose / Triggered When**                              |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sitting`     | Default state ‚Äî idle character posture                    |
| `waving`      | When drone is near (proximity logic triggers this)        |
| `turn_right`  | Used to face the First Aid Kit (always turns right)       |
| `walk`        | Move toward the First Aid Kit using root motion           |
| `pickup`      | Plays the animation to pick up the First Aid Kit          |
| `saved`       | Indicates the character has completed the rescue sequence |



üìù Revised Transition Table
From State	To State	Conditions
Sitting	Waving	waving == true && saved == false
Waving	Sitting	waving == false
Sitting	Turn Right	turn_right == true && saved == false
Turn Right	Walk	walk == true && angleToKit < 30¬∞
Turn Right	Turn Right	walk == true && angleToKit >= 30¬∞ (loop turn)
Turn Right	Sitting	turn_right == false (emergency exit)
Walk	Pickup	pickup == true && kitDistance <= 0.5f
Walk	Sitting	pickup == false && kitDistance > 5f (emergency exit)
Pickup	Sitting	pickup == false && ExitTime=0.9
 pickup == false && sitting == true
Final: At end of sequence, saved = true
